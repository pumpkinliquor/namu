			<header>Greetings from the President</header>
			<p>I have been working as a gastroenterologist at a university for more than 40 years, and my dream <br>was to build a hospital brings wellness to patients as well as those who are healthy.  In 2008, the <br>Vievis Namuh Hospital was established to become a hospital that can diagnose diseases and <br>provide all the care necessary for our customers to become healthy. </p>

			<p>As Korea's first and best to specialize in gastrointestinal diseases, Vievis Namuh<br> 
			Hospital strives to offer the best solution for individual situation and characteristics, including<br> health screenings, outpatient treatments, and surgeries. </p>

			<p>We are equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment at the level of to <br>
			university hospitals, and all of our specialists consist of doctors who have served as professors at<br> university hospitals. We have improved the quality of medical services by having all of our <br>specialists in gastroenterology obtain the license as gastrointestinal endoscopy specialists. </p>

			<p>In addition to improving the quality of treatment, we have enhanced the convenience through a<br> one-stop system that allows both examination and result consultation on the day of treatment. <br>We are also taking charge to organize programs that accommodate our customers by developing a<br> colonoscopy process that does not require patients to take laxatives. Vievis Namuh Hospital will<br> always do our best to promote everyone's digestive health. </p>
